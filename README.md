# FuelGauge 🚗⛽  
*A simple fuel tracker and performance app built with Flutter*  

## 📌 Overview  
FuelGauge is a mobile application designed to help vehicle owners track their fuel consumption and expenses.  
Users can log their mileage, date, fuel price, and liters filled at every refuel. The app then generates a history of entries, giving users a clearer picture of their fuel usage and spending habits.  

This project was developed as part of our **AppDev Midterm Mini-App Project**, focusing on applying Flutter fundamentals such as **OOP, UI design, and local data storage using `shared_preferences`**.
